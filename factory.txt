Pizza store

digitalize the pizza creation

This is not a design pattern, just programming idiom

The PizzaStore is very popular and they want to start 
franchize's in different parts

But the franchize's have altered the way they make the pizzas
And the owner doesn't want them to do it.

The fm pattern defines an interface/ abstract for creating an object but lets
subclass decide which class to instantiate.
